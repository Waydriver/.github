# Waydriver

Waydriver is a cutting-edge task management system that empowers you to conquer
complex projects with ease. Seamlessly break down your projects into tasks, map
their interdependencies, and chart the optimal route to achieve your goals.

## This is a work in progress

I'm planning to continue working on this in my spare time. Currently, it is not
in a workable state, and probably won't be for some time (there isn't even a
frontend yet). Hopefully it'll be ready to try out soon!
